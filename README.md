# Welcome to Ship O Cereal by Group-43

## Describe your project
// THESE ARE THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS WE MADE //
We're making a website which sells cereals and anything relating to cereals.
In this project we decided to include a "Login/Register user" feature.
We also Session store the contact and payment info so that the user
can keep his settings saved if he wishes to make a new purchase.
After making a purchase, the cart is automatically emptied.
The user can remove items in the cart and instead of overflowing
the cart it adds to quantity when adding an item twice.
We have a super user who can add to the database directly from the website, and that is any product.
